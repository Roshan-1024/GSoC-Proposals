# GSoC-Proposals

## GSoC 2025

I had submitted two proposals to the Holidays Framework during my First Year of College:

### Proposal 1 (Rejected)
**Title:** Support for Multilevel Subdivisions, Multi-Subdivision Queries, and Localization System Revamp

**Note:** A more coding-focused proposal involving architectural changes and feature development.

### Proposal 2 (Rejected)
**Title:** Expanding Global Holiday Coverage: Batch 4 Country Integration

**Note:** Primarily involved structured data entry and country-wise holiday data integration.

### Insights:
- On the Proposal Submission Deadline, the mentors advised me to include _Multilevel Subdivision Support_ in **Proposal 1** to make it **"more appealing"**.
- They had suggested me to take the _Batch 4 Country Integration_ and therefore I also submitted a 2nd proposal.
